<h2>Tenants Rights Campaign</h2>
Baton Rouge DSA voted to prioritize a Tenants Rights campaign with the ultimate goal of creating a citywide Tenants Union. We believe that by working together, tenants can take back control of their homes from the wealthy elites who own everything and charge us perpetual rent while contributing nothing. Landlords are organized, tenants should be too. If you agree and are interested in joining this campaign, [join our email list](https://actionnetwork.org/forms/join-brdsa) and consider [joining DSA](https://act.dsausa.org/donate/membership/?source=Baton%20Rouge).

<h2>FITE</h2>
Famine Is The Enemy (FITE) is an independent mutual aid organization run mostly by Baton Rouge DSA members. It serves food each Saturday from 12-1pm at N 14th Street Park. FITE is interested in expanding its work into clothes and healthcare distribution as well as embracing the true meaning of mutual aid through community education and empowerment. Follow them [@fite_br on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/fite_br/) and join on a Saturday to get involved.

<h2>Boycott Chevron</h2>
The Chevron corporation supplies Israel’s war machine with energy and massive tax money via the operation and co-ownership of the major Israeli-claimed fossil gas fields in the Mediterranean. Both Chevron and Israel enrich themselves from these projects – continuing a pattern of ongoing colonial violence, apartheid, and climate degradation. We echo the call from the Palestinian Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement along with DSA chapters across the country to build pressure on Chevron through boycott and divestment campaigns until it no longer conducts business that gravely violates Palestinian human rights and benefits Israel’s genocidal regime of settler-colonial apartheid.
