## What is it?

**Famine Is The Enemy** (FITE) is a mutual aid group that serves food (and other donations) to the community each Saturday from 12-1pm at [North 14th Street Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GJhM7rvKNZgw9kZF9). 

FITE is always looking for volunteers to cook, serve, or donate materials. [Follow us on Instagram!](https://www.instagram.com/fite_br/)
