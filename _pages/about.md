We are the Baton Rouge Chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America. We are a working class organization for the people of the Baton Rouge Metropolitan Area. We believe a better world is possible than one that puts capital & profit over people and believe in the deconstruction of imperialism, capitalism, racism, sexism and other social constructions that sustain systems of oppression at large.

We are in support of 'true' Democracy that allows people to participate and have a say in policy and issues that affect their lives. We are in favor community collectivism via co-operation and mutual aid because We Are All That We have. We support labor organizing and labor unions in our area.

As a part of a network of chapters that make up Louisiana DSA and the National organization that is DSA we are not closed and have members from a variety of left political perspectives and groups of social identity. For more information contact us.
