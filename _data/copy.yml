  about: "<b>This the website for Baton Rouge DSA.</b> Democratic socialists believe both the economy and society should be run democratically to meet human needs, not to make profits for the wealthy. We are a working class organization for the people of the Baton Rouge Metropolitan Area. We believe a better world is possible than one that puts capital & profit over people and believe in the deconstruction of imperialism, capitalism, racism, sexism and other social constructions that sustain systems of oppression at large."
