    The Baton Rouge Chapter of the <a href="https://act.dsausa.org/donate/membership/?source=Baton%20Rouge">Democratic Socialists of America</a> (BRDSA) is a working class organization for the people of the Greater Baton Rouge Area. We believe that the economy and society should be run democratically to meet human needs, not to make profits. Our mission is to create a <strong>true democracy</strong> that puts the people in control of their lives and community. We are organizing tenants, supporting workers, constructing mutual aid networks, educating the public, and standing in solidarity with resistance movements around the globe. We advance our demands for a better world through collaboration with unions, community service groups, and student organizations.
