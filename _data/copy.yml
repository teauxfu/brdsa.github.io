    <a href="https://act.dsausa.org/donate/membership/?source=Baton%20Rouge">Democratic socialists</a> believe both the economy and society should be run democratically to meet human needs, not to make profits for the wealthy. We are a working class organization for the people of the Greater Baton Rouge Area. We believe a better world is possible than one that puts capital & profit over people and believe in the deconstruction of imperialism, capitalism, racism, sexism and other social constructions that sustain systems of oppression at large.
