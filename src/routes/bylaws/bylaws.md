## PREAMBLE

The Baton Rouge LA Local Chapter of Democratic Socialists of America seeks to democratize our society and economy through organized collective action. We reject the status quo. We reject an economic order based solely on private profit, alienated labor, gross inequalities of wealth and power, and discrimination based on race, gender, age, ability, or sexual orientation. We reject brutality and violence of all kinds. We believe in a transition to a humane social order based on democratic control of resources, production, and economic planning; equitable distribution; gender and racial equality, and non-oppressive relationships. 

We believe we have the resources and technology to end hunger, save the planet, and better our children's futures. We are committed to a freedom of speech that includes the freedom to dissent, to a freedom to organize independent trade unions, support groups, political parties, and any collective that might help protect us from the dangers of a militarized police force, rich corporations and monopolies, and other forces that may seek to exploit and control the people. We are committed to a freedom of religion that acknowledges the rights of those for whom spiritual concerns are central. We seek to empower our members and our communities.

We are socialists because we believe in democracy. We believethe power of the people to maintain control over our lives is the key to fulfilling our human potential; whereas the right of a small wealthy elite to own the majority of our vital resources is the path to subjugation and social turmoil. We are socialists because we believe the eventual automation of labor will result in a dystopian nightmare under capitalism, whereas it could mean more time for people to learn and advance under socialism. We seek to build a new democratic and vibrant left movement in the South, as a part of the national movement that has the ability to make democratic socialism in the United States a reality. 


## ARTICLE 1: NAME

The name of this organization will be Baton Rouge Democratic Socialists of America, also known as BRDSA, and referred to throughout this document as “the Chapter.” Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) is a not-for-profit corporation.


## ARTICLE 2: BASIC ORGANIZATION AND CONVENTION

### Section 1: General Membership.

The Chapter shall meet in Convention annually during the first six months of the year, with at least thirty days’ notice given to all members.

### Section 8: Quorum.

Unless specified otherwise in these bylaws, a quorum of ten percent or 5 members, whichever is larger, of the membership shall be required for valid meetings of the Convention, Special Meetings, or General Meetings to occur.

 The revenue of this Chapter shall be derived from a portion of  national dues shared by national DSA, sale of supplies, interest on deposits, grants, and donations. It is the duty of every officer, agent, employee, and representative of this Chapter to hold its money and property solely for the benefit of the Chapter and the duty of its members to manage, invest, and expend the same in accordance with these Bylaws and any resolutions of the governing bodies adopted thereunder, to refrain from dealing with this Chapter as an adverse party in any matter connected with duties and from holding or acquiring any financial or personal interest that conflicts with the interest of this Chapter, and to account to this organization for any profit received under direction on its behalf. 

Since the Highest Decision-Making Body is vested in the Officers Council between General Meetings, the Chapter Council and the Chapter Treasurer in addition to the General Meeting shall manage, invest and expend the funds and property of this Chapter in accordance with all applicable provisions of these Bylaws and any resolution adopted by the Chapter and General Meeting not inconsistent therewith.

#### Section 9(b).

Except as otherwise provided in Chapter Bylaws, the revenue of the Chapter will be divided into a General Fund, a Rapid Solidarity Fund, and other committee-based funds, at the discretion of the General Meeting or of the Chapter Council between General Meetings.

#### Section 9(d).

Chapter Council and committee funds shall be maintained and disbursed in accordance with the authority vested in Article Five (5) and in accordance with the provisions in Article Twelve (12) of these Bylaws.

Members in good standing who cannot vote in person due to unavoidable conflicts must notify the Officers in advance of the vote, and name the proxy voter. A member who is present at an election meeting may only hold up to two proxies.

### Section 4: Member Discipline, Suspension, and Expulsion. 

A two-thirds vote of members in good standing is required to suspend or expel a member from the Local  Chapter. In all cases, prior to discipline, the members and Officers should consider and abide by the principles of privacy, accountability, and restorative justice. In order for such a finding to be made, another DSA member must formally prefer written charges against the member in question to the  Local Chapter Officers’ Council, which will set the date of a  Local Chapter meeting for deliberations on the charges. The member in question must receive a copy of the written charges and notice of the meeting a minimum of two (2) weeks before that meeting takes place. An expelled member in good standing may appeal to the National Political Committee of DSA.

Members may be suspended or expelled (1.) if they are found to have maliciously inflicted serious emotional or physical harm against another member, (2.) if they are found to be in substantial disagreement with the principles or policies of the organization, including, but not limited to, engaging in behavior or speech that violates DSA’s commitment to anti-racism, feminism, and equality, or (3.) if they consistently engage in undemocratic, disruptive behavior, or if they are found to be engaging in intentionally subversive activities to the detriment of the chapter, or acting on behalf of or under the direction of another organization or body aiming to disrupt the Chapter's activities, membership, or events.

### Section 5: Privacy Concerns.

Care will be taken to protect the privacy of each member’s information and the safety of all potential new members will be considered when open invitations to social events or meetings occur. The Chapter will encourage members not to share names and contact information publicly.

### Section 1: Nominations. 

All Officers of the Chapter shall be elected at the Annual Convention. Nominations to run for the position of Officer must be submitted to the Chapter at least 30 days in advance of the Convention.

Notice may be sent by electronic means, but individuals who have not provided an email address must be sent a paper copy or contacted by phone or text, provided the individual has given a physical address.

### Section 4: Recall of Officers. 

Pursuant to Article 2, Section 4, Officers’ Council Members, including those appointed by committees, may be recalled by a two-thirds vote of the Special Meeting as gathered. If removed by two-thirds vote, said member  may not stand for or serve as a Committee Representative to the Officers’ Council or a Chapter’s Officer for one year.

The officer in question must receive written documentation of the specific reasons for the removal request and notice of the meeting a minimum of two weeks before the meeting takes place.  The accused officer will be given a chance to speak in their own defense at this meeting.

### Section 5: Voting 

In an election for Officers Council positions, voting will be done in-person (except for proxy voting allowed in Article 3, Section 3) and anonymously, and will be open to all members in good standing. Quorum is necessary to validate the results of any election. The Candidates for a given position will be announced by a Voting Commissioner, and members will anonymously fill in their ballots. Once voting has finished, ballots will be turned in to the Voting Commissioner, who will randomize the ballots by hand, and then tally the results. Members may only be a Candidate for one position. If they are nominated for more than one position, the member will choose one position for which they will be a Candidate. For the positions of Co-Chairs, each ballot will contain three Candidates. None of the votes are weighted. The top three vote-getters will be elected to co-chair. If all three of the top vote getters are cis straight white men, then the third-highest vote getter will be excluded and the highest candidate that is not a cis straight white man will be elected. Each ballot will include one candidate for Treasurer and one candidate for Secretary. The highest vote-getter will be elected to each position. Any future positions on the Officers Council will be subject to the same rules as those that apply to the Treasurer and Secretary. The Voting Commissioner will be a member in good standing, who is selected by acclamation at the meeting prior to the election. The Voting Commissioner cannot be a candidate for any council position.
