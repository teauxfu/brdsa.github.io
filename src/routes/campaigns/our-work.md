## 🏠⚖️ Tenant Rights 

In 2024, Baton Rouge DSA voted to prioritize a Tenants Rights campaign with the ultimate goal of creating a citywide Tenants Union. We believe that by working together, tenants can take back control of their homes from the wealthy elites who own everything and charge us perpetual rent while contributing nothing. Landlords are organized, tenants should be too. If you agree and are interested in joining this campaign, [join our email list](https://actionnetwork.org/forms/join-brdsa) and consider [joining DSA](https://act.dsausa.org/donate/membership/?source=Baton%20Rouge).

## 🗽🌎 Immigrant Rights 

BRDSA has been developing relationships with local immigrant advocacy organizations and developing workshops to educate our community about how to defend their neighbors from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and why it must be abolished. Join our chapter's International Working Group to learn how you can contribute to this work. 

## 🚫⛽ Boycott Chevron 

The Chevron corporation supplies Israel’s war machine with energy and massive tax money via the operation and co-ownership of the major Israeli-claimed fossil gas fields in the Mediterranean. Both Chevron and Israel enrich themselves from these projects – continuing a pattern of ongoing colonial violence, apartheid, and climate degradation. We echo the call from the Palestinian Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement along with DSA chapters across the country to build pressure on Chevron through boycott and divestment campaigns until it no longer conducts business that gravely violates Palestinian human rights and benefits Israel’s genocidal regime of settler-colonial apartheid.
