## What is it?

**Famine Is The Enemy** (FITE) is a mutual aid group that serves food (and other donations) to the community each Saturday from 12-1pm at [North 14th Street Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GJhM7rvKNZgw9kZF9). 

FITE is always looking for volunteers to cook, serve, or donate materials. [Follow FITE on Instagram!](https://www.instagram.com/fite_br/)

## Donate

You can donate to FITE in person by coming to our Saturday food distro, or online donating to Baton Rouge DSA and including a message that you would like your donation to be used for FITE.

You can set up recurring [donations to Baton Rouge DSA](/donate/) or make a one-time donation via [Venmo](https://venmo.com/u/BRDSA). Donations to FITE and Baton Rouge DSA are _not_ tax deductible.
