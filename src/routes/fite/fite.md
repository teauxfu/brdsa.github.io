## What is it?

**Famine Is The Enemy** (FITE) is a mutual aid group that serves food (and other donations) to the community each Saturday from 12-1pm at [North 14th Street Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GJhM7rvKNZgw9kZF9). Check out [this article in WAFB](https://www.wafb.com/story/37165041/were-all-in-this-together-fite-works-to-help-the-less-fortunate/) to learn more about how we got started. 

FITE is always looking for volunteers to cook, serve, or donate materials. [Follow FITE on Instagram!](https://www.instagram.com/fite_br/)

## Donate

Baton Rouge DSA committed to funding FITE during its July 2025 general meeting. Donations earmarked for FITE will only be spent for supplies directly supporting mutual aid and community care. 

You can donate to FITE in person by coming to our Saturday food distro, or online. You can set up recurring [donations to FITE](/fite/donate) or make a one-time donation. Small, recurring donations make the most impact. Donations to FITE and Baton Rouge DSA are _not_ tax deductible.
