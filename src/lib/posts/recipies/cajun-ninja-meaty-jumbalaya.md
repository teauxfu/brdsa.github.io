I use a 17.75"L x 11"W x 9"H Magnalite pot with lid and everything fits.
 
3.5 hours cooking, 1.5 hour prep to chop everything

## Ingredients 

- 10 Onions
- 5 Bell Pepper
- 5 Bunch Green Onion
- 10 Sticks of Celery
- 20 Cloves of Garlic
- 3 lb Pork Roast
- Kosher Salt & Pepper (to season pork)
- 3 Tablespoon Vegetable Oil
- 3 lb Boneless Chicken Thighs
- 3 lb Smoked Sausage
- 15 Beef Bouillon Cubes
- 2.5 Tablespoon of Cajun or Creole Seasoning
- 5 Teaspoon of Salt
- 17.5 Cups Water
- 5 Tablespoon of Hot Sauce
- 5 Tablespoon of Browning Sauce
- 10 Cups Rice

## Steps
 
Chop the Onions, Bell Pepper, Green Onions, Celery and Garlic. Put in a container and move to the fridge.
Prep the pork and chicken by cutting into cube like pieces.
Slice the sausage.

Start out by heating a large pot over Medium Heat.
Season the pork well with kosher salt and pepper.
Add the vegetable oil to the pot and sear the pork for 20 minutes.
After 20 minutes of cooking the pork, add the Chicken to the Pork and cook for another 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Remove the Chicken and Pork, then brown the Sausage for another 10-15 minutes.
After 10-15 minutes, Remove the Sausage so that there's nothing left but the drippings.

Add the Onion, Bell Pepper, Green Onion, Celery, Garlic, and sautÃ© for roughly 40 minutes.
After 40 minutes, Add the beef bouillon cubes, cajun seasoning, and salt.
SautÃ© for another 10 minutes.

At this point preheat your oven to 300Â°
Add the Water, Meats, Rice, Hot Sauce, Browning Sauce, and stir.
Bring the mix to a boil, once boiling, cover, turn the fire off, and put the pot in the oven.
Cook for exactly 1 hour. REMEMBER, DO NOT TOUCH that oven! Leave it alone! Trust me ðŸ˜Š

Once done, remove the jambalaya, and set aside for 5 minutes. DO NOT UNCOVER UNTIL TIME IS UP!
When the time is up, remove the cover, mix everything well, and serve.
Hope you enjoy!
