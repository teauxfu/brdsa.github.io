### Smaller pot

- 3 large stalks celery, diced
- 9 tsp minced garlic
- 1 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 6 tsp minced thyme
- 3 bay leaves

- 3 tsp pepper
- Some olive oil (or other oil)

## Steps

In two large soup pots, sauté the onions, celery, and garlic in some olive oil until the onions are clear.
Add the other seasonings.
Add the water and the black eyed peas.  Mix, cover, and bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to a simmer and cook covered, stirring often, until the black eyed peas reach the desired softness, or for about 1½-2 hours.
If the beans become too dry, add more water.
Add the collard greens and cook for the last 10 minutes.
Once the liquid is reduced, you can put the contents of both pots into the bigger pot for easier transportation.
